Scientifically there's a correlation between less amount of sleep and tending to overeat. As I'm on a diet right now, I have data from these sources:

- Healthkit
- Macrofactor (Dieting app)

My objective is to train a ML algorithm that is capable of predicting if I will overeat or keep my calories as close as possible to the objective based on the following data:
- Hours slept
- Caloric intake for the day
- Calorie objective
